# Time Journal

## An application to keep track of where you spend your time. 

Have you ever had a week go by and by the end of it, realize that you have no idea what you did that week? By keeping
 track of how we spend our time, we can take control of our actions to live more productive and well-balanced lives. 
 
_**Why Journaling?**_<br>
Research has shown that journaling can have powerful mental health benefits and act as a documentation tool for everyday
life. Time Journal takes journaling a step further by allowing you to record how much time you spend on the activities
and organize them into meaningful categories. 
 
_**How does it work?**_<br>
You will be able to create categories for your activities and see on average how much time you spend on each one. 
This application will combine common approaches to journaling and budgeting to create visibility into where your time
 goes. You'll also be able to set monthly goals for each category, and be notified if you're not meeting your goals. 
 
Whether you'd like to use Time Journal as a journal or a budgeting tool is up to you. <br>
